## OPC UA IIoT StarterKit – Quickstart 001
### Building a Simple Publisher and Subscriber

OPC UA PubSub is designed to support the needs of a large number of industrial automation users which means the specification has a lot of content. However, a user that has basic needs can ignore most of the specification. This quickstart demonstrates how to build a minimumal Publisher and Subscriber that conforms to the specification. 

The quickstart also does not rely on any OPC UA specific libraries. All of the code needed to implement the Publisher and Subscriber are part of the solution.
